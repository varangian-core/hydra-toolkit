User: User: Update the project log with today's progress.

Assistant: Today I worked on analyzing the data for our latest customer survey. I used pandas to load the data into a DataFrame and explored the data structure using describe(), info(), and head() functions. I looked at the distribution of responses, identified variables with high missing values, and cleaned the data according to the requirements. I will use this information to determine the best approach for visualization and analytics.
